Analyzing Indoor Movement Patterns
via Raspberry Pi Network

Motivation and objectif

Understanding how people move through physical spaces is becoming increasingly valuable in the age of
ubiquitous connectivity and intelligent systems. Whether students navigate the halls of a university or
customers browsing a shopping mall, their journeys tell a story that can inform design, improve services,
and create more efficient environments.
This project focuses on developing an indoor circulation graph using Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
A circulation graph is a dynamic graph that models the flow or movement of entities through a network
over time. In the context of indoor spaces, nodes represent physical locations (e.g., hallways, classrooms, or
stores), and edges represent detected transitions or movement flows between these locations.
The objective of this Pi2 project is twofold. First, to develop a Raspberry Pi-based network of sniffing devices for capturing Wi-Fi and Bluetooth packets. Second, to design and implement a Python-based
prototype capable of analyzing and visualizing spatio-temporal behavioral patterns extracted from a circulation graph constructed using data from the sniffing devices. This system will enable the identification of
high-traffic zones and reveal the temporal dynamics of movement between key areas.

Methodology

The first step in this exploration will be to turn Raspberry Pi devices into sniffers capable of detecting Wi-Fi
or Bluetooth signals from nearby smartphones [?, ?]. Using Python and libraries such as scapy or Pi Sniffer,
students will develop a prototype that listens to ambient wireless traffic and logs anonymized data about
device presence. This data will include elements like MAC addresses (anonymized or hashed), timestamps,
and the identity of the sniffer that captured the packet.
Once the basic functionality is in place, the system must be tested in a controlled environment. This phase
will allow students to assess the effective range of detection, the impact of obstacles, and the consistency
of data capture [?]. This step is crucial for understanding the limitations and practical realities of passive
sniffing.
With validated sniffers in hand, the next challenge will be scaling up. Then, students will work to design
and deploy a network of these devices across selected indoor locations, for example, in classrooms in a
university building or corridors in a mall. The devices will need to communicate with each other or a central
server. Time synchronization will be critical to maintaining network coherence, so NTP can be used to align
clocks across devices.
Data obtained by the sniffer should then be stored in a centralized database (like SQLite3 or MySQL),
a MongoDB database, or even a cloud-based solution. The proposal should be able to store raw packets, as
well as derived transitions between sniffers (indicating user movement). From this structure, the circulation
graph will begin to take form.

The graph will be built using Python-based graph libraries such as networkx or igraph. Each zone a
sniffer covers will be a node in the graph, and edges will represent detected movements [?, ?]. With this
structure in place, students will have a powerful tool to explore mobility patterns [?].
